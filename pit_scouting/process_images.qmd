## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(magick)

#Process images from imported dataset and convert them to pngs (all in vector_pics array)
pit_data<-read.csv("pit_scouting_2026.csv")

# taking links and converting them to images
pic_link <- pit_data$Upload.robot.photo
pics_link <- gsub("open\\?id=", "uc?export=download&id=", pic_link)

#convert to vector and apply image_read on every img in pics_link
vector_pics<-sapply(pics_link,image_read) 

if (!dir.exists("robot_pics")) dir.create("robot_pics")
for (i in seq_along(vector_pics)) { 
    image_write(vector_pics[[i]], path = paste0("robot_pics/robot_",i, ".png"), format = "png")}

#Check to see all image files are pngs
# vector_pics <- image_join(vector_pics)
# imginfo <- image_info(vector_pics)
# print(imginfo)



```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
